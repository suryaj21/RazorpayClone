# RazorpayClone
Tailwind CSS project

I recently completed a project that replicates the user interface and user experience of India's leading online payment gateway, Razorpay. This visually appealing front-end project was crafted using the versatile Tailwind CSS framework. While it emulates the aesthetics and interactions of Razorpay, please note that it's a front-end replica and does not include full operational functionality. The project showcases the power and flexibility of Tailwind CSS in creating a beautiful and responsive user interface for online payment processing.
